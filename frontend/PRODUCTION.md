# Production Deployment Guide

## üöÄ Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Security Requirements ‚úÖ
- [ ] JWT_SECRET is set and at least 32 characters long
- [ ] MONGO_URI is configured with production database
- [ ] All environment variables are properly set
- [ ] Debug endpoints are disabled in production
- [ ] Rate limiting is enabled
- [ ] Input validation is implemented
- [ ] Authentication middleware is active

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file with:
```bash
# Required
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key_at_least_32_characters_long_for_security
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/database_name

# Optional
NODE_ENV=production
LOG_LEVEL=info
```

## üîí Security Features Implemented

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication with secure secret validation
- Role-based access control (admin/user)
- Protected API routes with middleware
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt

### Input Validation & Sanitization
- Comprehensive input validation for all endpoints
- XSS protection through input sanitization
- SQL injection protection via Mongoose
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse

### Security Headers
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Build the Application
```bash
npm run build
npm run type-check
npm run lint
```

### 2. Environment Setup
```bash
# Validate environment variables
npm run build  # This will fail if required vars are missing
```

### 3. Database Setup
```bash
# Ensure MongoDB is accessible from production server
# Test connection with production credentials
```

### 4. Deploy
```bash
npm start
```

## üìä Monitoring & Logging

### Log Levels
- **ERROR**: Critical errors that need immediate attention
- **WARN**: Warning conditions that should be monitored
- **INFO**: General information about application flow
- **DEBUG**: Detailed debugging information (development only)

### External Logging Services
Configure one of these services for production:
- Sentry (error tracking)
- LogRocket (session replay)
- DataDog (monitoring)
- New Relic (APM)

## üîç Production Testing

### Security Tests
```bash
# Run security audit
npm run security-check

# Test rate limiting
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/users/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"test","password":"test"}'

# Test authentication
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/admin/users \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

### Performance Tests
```bash
# Bundle analysis
npm run analyze

# Load testing (install artillery or similar)
npm install -g artillery
artillery quick --count 100 --num 10 http://localhost:3000/
```

## üö® Incident Response

### Security Breach Protocol
1. **Immediate Response**
   - Disable affected endpoints
   - Rotate JWT secrets
   - Review access logs

2. **Investigation**
   - Analyze security logs
   - Check for data breaches
   - Review recent deployments

3. **Recovery**
   - Patch vulnerabilities
   - Restore from backup if needed
   - Update security measures

## üìà Performance Optimization

### Database
- Enable MongoDB query optimization
- Use database indexes for frequent queries
- Monitor connection pool usage

### Application
- Enable Next.js optimizations
- Use CDN for static assets
- Implement caching strategies

### Monitoring
- Set up health checks
- Monitor response times
- Track error rates

## üîÑ Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- [ ] Security updates (weekly)
- [ ] Dependency updates (monthly)
- [ ] Security audit (quarterly)
- [ ] Performance review (monthly)

### Backup Strategy
- Database backups (daily)
- Configuration backups (weekly)
- Code repository backups (continuous)

## üìû Support

For production issues:
1. Check application logs
2. Review monitoring dashboards
3. Contact development team
4. Escalate to security team if needed
